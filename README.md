While frequentist approaches are often more practical for large datasets, Bayesian data analytics is sometimes favoured particularly in sports quantitative modelling, 
where the training data is relatively small and limited, 
necessitating the incorporation of strong priors from sports experts or traders. 

Here we presented a few applications of Bayesian regression and data analysis, including sports game predicting, car insurance regression and time series forecasting.
